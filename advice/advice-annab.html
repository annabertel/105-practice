          <h3>My big picture advice: <br> TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF LIKE YOU MEAN IT.</h3>
          <p>When we are well <br> (physically, emotionally, and otherwise) <br> shit starts falling into place. <br> Commit to something that makes you feel whole; <br> Let go of something that doesn't. <br> Smile at the energetic rewards for your effort! <br> Then, guide this new source of energy <br> towards learning to code <br> ...or wherever you feel compelled to guide it... <br>Because you know. Listen :)

            <p>Your brain and body are working overtime to support your coding journey — show 'em a couple minutes of love, <br>right from your chair...but first get up and walk around if you haven't for a while :) </p>

              <h5>Massage the back of your neck</h5>
              <p>while taking another one to two deep breaths here <br> then repeat for your shoulders, and temples </p>
              <h5>Loosen up your neurological highway</h5>
              <p>a gentle side bend (and a breath or two!) to each side <br> a gentle twist to each side <br> then a gentle arch forwards and backwards</p>
              <h5>Close your eyes. Set an intention. Smile a bit.</h5>
